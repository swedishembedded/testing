This repository adds CMock and Unity testing support to any Zephyr based
project. It is primarily used by [Swedish Embedded Platform
SDK](https://github.com/swedishembedded/sdk) to implement full coverage testing
support.

## What is full coverage testing?

When you are developing embedded systems, you are often dealing with code that
is designed to run on actual hardware. This makes testing more difficult and
very often you can not easily test all code paths.

CMock solves this problem.

Unity provides test assertion macros for C.

This repository adds CMock and Unity support to your project.

Enjoy!
